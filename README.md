# Brute
Brute is a project for monitoring authentication attempts on servers using OpenSSH. It tracks and records each attempt and provides detailed information about the person who made the attempt.
<br><br>
Currently, this project must use a specific version of OpenSSH. Unfortunately, the changes made to this may compromise the security of your server, so use with <b>caution</b>.

* <b>Straightforward</b> — Simply call the endpoint ```/brute/attack/add```, and Brute will log, analyze, and store the credentials for you.
* <b>Extendable Metrics</b> — Brute allows developers to easily add or remove metrics as needed. You can easily integrate additional metrics or connect an API with minimal effort to Brute.
* <b>Location Information</b> — Information can be easily accessed through the [Ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io//) API, which is integrated into Brute. This integration allows for retrieval of detailed data from the individual's IP address.

## Installation
*Ubuntu 22.04 was used*

Before we begin setting up and installing Brute & OpenSSH, ensure you have downloaded the following libraries and tools.
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev 
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libpam0g-dev
sudo apt install autoconf checkinstall
```
### OpenSSH
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notpointless/openssh-9.8-patched
cd openssh-portable
autoreconf
./configure --with-pam --with-privsep-path=/var/lib/sshd/ --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh
```
```
sudo make
sudo checkinstall
```
After you run the commands above, a UI will show up. Make sure that your settings look like this:
```
0 -  Maintainer: [Your Name <you@example.com>]
1 -  Summary: [OpenSSH Portable]
2 -  Name:    [openssh-portable]
3 -  Version: [9.8p1]   <-- Enter your chosen version here
4 -  Release: [1]
5 -  License: [GPL]
6 -  Group:   [checkinstall]
7 -  Architecture: [amd64]
8 -  Source location: [openssh-8.9p1]
9 -  Alternate source location: [ ]
10 - Requires: [ ]
11 - Provides: [openssh-portable]
12 - Conflicts: [ ]
13 - Replaces: [ ]
```
After building and installing, now you need to replace the old SSH with the new one. You can do that with these commands.
```
sudo systemctl stop ssh

# before we run these commands we should make a backup first.
sudo cp -R /etc/ssh /etc/ssh_backup

sudo mv /usr/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh_old
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh

sudo mv /usr/sbin/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd_old
sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd
```
Now run ```sudo systemctl start ssh``` and run ```ssh -V```. If the following message pops up that means you successfully setup OpenSSH.
```
(Brute) OpenSSH_9.8...
```
Before we proceed to the next section, we need to disable the penalty system that was recently introduced in OpenSSH.
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Add these fields to sshd_config (first one is all you need.)
PerSourcePenalties no
PerSourcePenaltyExemptList 0.0.0.0/0
PerSourcePenaltyExemptList 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0

sudo sshd -t
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Pam
Before proceeding with the next steps, we need to compile the PAM module. To do that, follow these instructions:
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/bruteexposed/pam.git
cmake .
make
# the file should now be in /lib/pam_module.so ... you can rename it to pam_brute.so if you wish.
```
*note: before compiling ensure you set BRUTE_BEARER_TOKEN and BRUTE_POST_URL accordingly inside the library.c file.*

All PAM modules should be located in ```/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/```. Simply place the brute PAM module (pam_brute.so) in this directory.
You can use ```scp pam_brute.so {username}@{address}:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/``` from your local computer to copy the file into there. Before running SCP command ensure you have write access to the directory.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth

original /etc/pam.d/common-auth
# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
auth    requisite                       pam_deny.so

to

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth    [success=2 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok
# enable Brute.
auth    optional                        pam_brute.so
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
auth    requisite                       pam_deny.so
```
### Brute
Now we can compile the actual Brute application. Ensure you have rustup & cargo installed.
```
# we need this for cargo.
sudo apt install pkg-config

git clone https://github.com/bruteexposed/brute.git
cd brute
sudo cargo build
./brute
```

## Integrating your own metrics
You can quickly add your metrics by following these steps: create a table using Diesel CLI, add the metric model to ```models.rs```, implement the required functionality, and then integrate it into the ```add()``` function located in ```brute.rs```.

### Generating a migration for a table
```up.sql``` and ```down.sql``` were generated by running the following command: ```diesel migration generate create_attacks_hourly```
```sql
-- these files will be empty when they're generated.
-- They're located in /migrations. Ensure you run 
-- diesel migration run --database-url=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/brute
-- after modifying the tables accordingly.
```
```sql
-- up.sql
CREATE TABLE attacks_hourly (
    timestamp BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```
```sql
-- down.sql
DROP TABLE attacks_hourly
```
### Adding the table to models.rs
```rust
#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, AsChangeset, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::attacks_hourly)]
#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::pg::Pg))]
/// If you're having errors ensure the table
/// was generated in schema.rs. It should
/// have auto generated the file and table.
pub struct AttacksHourly {
    pub timestamp: i64,
    pub amount: i32,
}
```
### Implementing functionality
```rust
// brute.rs
// the function should not be pub and should be async.
async fn add_attack_hourly(&self) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut conn = self.inner.pool.get().await?;
    // implemenation here.
    Ok(())
}
```
### Integrating the metric to .add()
```rust
// brute.rs
// locate add(..) and add the metric.
pub async fn add(
        &mut self,
        username: &str,
        password: &str,
        ip_address: &str,
        protocol: &str,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
        // metric is now active.
        self.add_attack_hourly().await?;
        Ok(())
    }
```
